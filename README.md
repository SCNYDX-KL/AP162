# AP162: A Large-scale Dataset for Agricultural Pest Recognition


We have provided a new agricultural pest image dataset in this warehouse, containing 162 categories and 194700 samples. AP162 takes into account both the visual appearance of agricultural pests and their harmful impact on crops, and adopts different subset partitioning strategies. From an agricultural perspective, pests are categorized based on the type of crop damage they cause to support targeted pest control, whereas from a visual perspective, classification relies on morphological similarity.
